## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirement Specification (SRS) provides a comprehensive collection of 
all specifications of the "Green Sprout" restaurant-finder application. It outlines the 
purpose, scope, and key details of the project. The SRS describes both functional and non functional requirements necessary for the development and delivery of the application.

### 1.2 Scope
This project will be a web-based application. 
The main actors of this application include reviewers and general 
visitors. 
The key features planned are:

- **Visual Map:** This map is the primary element of the user interface, displaying the 
area (e.g., Karlsruhe) and a set of location markers representing the restaurants at 
their respective locations.

- **Restaurant Profiles:** Each restaurant has a detailed profile that initially includes its 
name, type of cuisine, overall rating, and existing reviews. 

- **Registering as a Reviewer:** Users can create an account with their first name, last 
name, email address and a password of choice. This is necessary to gain the ability 
to publish reviews of restaurants. 

- **Adding a new Review:** Each restaurant on the map will have an "Add a Review" 
option, allowing users to write a review and provide a star rating.

- **Filtering Restaurant Searches:** Users will be able to filter restaurants based on 
cuisine type and diet.

### 3.2 Usability
#### 3.2.1 User Training and Learning Time
**Normal Users (General Visitors and Unregistered Users):** The application should be intuitive enough that a new user can browse restaurants, view details, and read reviews with minimal effort. No training should be required, and users should become proficient in basic tasks (e.g., navigating the map, searching restaurants) within a few minutes.  
**Power Users (Registered Reviewers):** Reviewers who will frequently submit reviews should become proficient in these more complex tasks after doing them once.

#### 3.2.2 Task Efficiency
**Restaurant Search and Filtering:** Users should be able to filter restaurant searches by 
cuisine type or diet within 5 clicks or taps. The results should update in under 3 seconds
on average.  
**Review Submission:** Registered users must be able to submit a new review with a star 
rating in under 1 minute, assuming an average internet connection.

#### 3.2.3 User Interface (UI) Standards
The UI should adhere to modern usability standards for web applications, such as providing a consistent layout across all pages, and easy-to-read fonts.  
Interactive elements (buttons, forms, filters) should be clearly distinguishable with appropriate spacing and color contrast.

#### 3.2.4 Error Handling and Feedback
Users must receive clear and concise feedback when an error occurs (e.g., invalid form 
inputs, failed review submission).  
The system should provide confirmations for critical actions such as submitting reviews 
or creating new restaurant lists.

### 3.3 Usability
#### 3.3.1 Availability
The system must be available 97% of the time.  
Scheduled maintenance windows should be communicated to users in advance.
#### 3.3.2 Fault Tolerance
The system must be capable of handling unexpected failures in the database, server, or network without causing a complete system shutdown.
#### 3.3.3 Data Integrity
The system must ensure that user reviews, restaurant profiles, and other critical data are stored safely, even in the event of hardware failure, power outages, or software crashes.  
Transaction management and database operations must follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles to guarantee data integrity.

### 3.4 Performance
#### 3.4.1 Response Time
The system must provide a response time of less than 3 seconds for all major user actions under normal conditions, including:
- Searching for restaurants
- Viewing restaurant profiles
- Submitting reviews and ratings
In high load conditions, the response time should not exceed 5 seconds.  

#### 3.4.2 Database Performance
Queries to the database (e.g., fetching restaurant details, reviews or ratings) must return results within 2 seconds under normal load and no more than 5 seconds under peak load.  
Bulk operations, such as batch importing of restaurant data, should complete within 15 minutes.

### 3.5 Supportability
#### 3.5.1 Coding Standards
The Green Sprout project will adhere to clean code principles and industry best practices, ensuring modular, maintainable, and scalable code.  
All code will follow standard naming conventions, proper indentation, and include sufficient comments to enhance readability and ease future development.  
Version control (Git) will be used to manage code changes, ensuring traceability and allowing for safe rollbacks when necessary.

#### 3.5.2 Testing Strategy
A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including automated unit tests.  

### 3.6 Design Constraints
**Technology Stack:** The application will be built using Vue.js for the frontend, Spring Boot with Java for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. These technologies define the framework and limit the design to what is supported by these tools.  

**Responsiveness:** The user interface must be designed to work seamlessly across various desktop devices, adhering to responsive design principles.  

**Data Storage:** The application will store user and restaurant data in a relational database (PostgreSQL), which constrains the design to a schema that ensures efficient querying and data integrity.  

**Security:** All design elements must consider security measures like encrypted  communication (HTTPS), authentication, and secure database access to protect user data and maintain privacy.

### 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements

The usage of the web application should be as intuitive as possible so it won't need any further documentation. If the user needs some help they should be able to contact the development team.
