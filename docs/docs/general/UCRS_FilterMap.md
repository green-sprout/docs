## Use-Case-Realization Specification: Use-Case Name

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Use-Case Realization Specification is to detail the design of the “Filter Map” use case, where a user selects filter criteria on an interactive map, which then displays points of interest that correspond to the filtered properties.

#### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the interaction flow between the User, Front-End, Back-End, and OpenStreetMap API for filtering and displaying points of interest based on user-selected criteria.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- POI: Point of Interest
- API: Application Programming Interface
- n/a: not applicable

#### 1.5 Overview
This document is organized into sections detailing the purpose, scope, and flow of events in this use case, followed by derived requirements for implementation.

### 2. Flow of Events—Design

The following describes the flow of events in the "Filter Map" use case. The sequence diagram is shown below for visual reference:

**Flow Steps:**
- **User Action:** The user selects filter keys on the front-end interface to define specific types of points of interest to display on the map.
- **Front-End Request:** The front-end sends a "request new map" message to the back end, including the user-selected filter keys.
- **Back-End to OpenStreetMap API:** The back end processes the request and sends a "request new points of interest" message to the OpenStreetMap API. This request includes the filter parameters specified by the user.
- **API Response:** The OpenStreetMap API returns data containing the filtered points of interest matching the criteria.
- **Back-End to Front-End:** The back end forwards the received data to the front-end as a "map" response.
- **Map Display:** The front-end processes and displays the updated map with the filtered points of interest for the user.

### 3. Derived Requirements

1. **Real-Time Data:** The system should update the map in real-time based on the user's selected filters.
2. **Error Handling:** If the OpenStreetMap API fails to respond or encounters an error, the system should notify the user and allow them to retry.
3. **Scalability:** The back end must efficiently handle multiple requests to the OpenStreetMap API without performance degradation.
4. **Data Accuracy:** The displayed points of interest must accurately reflect the filter criteria selected by the user.
